# Sibyl System

## Overview
The **Sibyl System** is a Conversation Simulation System (CSS) designed to facilitate and analyze interactions between a configurable number of entities, both AI and human, on a specified theme. The goal is to emulate realistic dialogues, providing insights into communication patterns, decision-making processes, and thematic discourse effectiveness.

## Objectives
- **Configurability**: Easily adjust the number of participating entities and select conversation themes according to user specifications.
- **Interactivity**: A seamless user interface that allows participants to engage in conversations naturally and coherently.
- **Realism**: Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are employed to simulate human-like responses, ensuring realistic dialogue exchanges.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Entity Configuration**: Users can configure the number and type of entities in the simulation, from fully AI-driven bots to human participants or a hybrid approach.
- **AI-Enhanced Conversations**: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP models to enhance realism in dialogues.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with Angular, the system provides a responsive and intuitive front-end.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Angular 16.1.0 for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend Services**: Integration with OpenAI and Firebase for AI models and authentication.
- **Database**: Firebase for real-time data management and storage.
- **UI Components**: PrimeNG and Bootstrap for styling and UI elements.

## Scripts
- `ng serve`: Start the development server.
- `ng build`: Build the project for production.
- `ng test`: Run unit tests using Karma.
- `ng start-prod`: Start the server in production mode.
  
## Potential Challenges
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the system performs well with a large number of simultaneous conversations.
- **Data Privacy**: Implementing strong security measures to safeguard sensitive user data.
- **NLP Accuracy**: Continuously improving the relevance and accuracy of AI-generated responses to create coherent and engaging conversations.

## Impact
The **Sibyl System** offers a controlled, measurable environment for dialogue simulations, making it a powerful tool for communication training, social research, and AI development. By refining AI's role in realistic human interactions, this project has applications in education, psychological research, and beyond.
